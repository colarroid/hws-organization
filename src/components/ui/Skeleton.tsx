 * The shapes a page wears while it is being fetched.

 * coming, which is the difference between a wait that feels like progress and
 * one that feels like a fault. These screens are read by somebody doing a job
 * rather than by somebody in difficulty, but the principle is the same, and a
 * portal that looks like it hung is a portal somebody stops posting to.
 *
 * Everything here is hidden from screen readers and the wait is announced
 * once, in words, by the page that uses it. A reader working through fourteen
 * unlabelled boxes is worse served than one told "Loading" and left alone.
